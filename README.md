Digital Wellbeing Tracker
The Digital Wellbeing Tracker is a Chrome extension designed to help users monitor their time spent on websites and receive gentle "nudges" to encourage breaks. It tracks activity per domain, displays it in a popup, and allows users to manage their tracked data and participate in a leaderboard.

Nudge Notifications: Provides an alert every 15 minutes of continuous activity on a single site, prompting the user to consider a break.
Tracked Time Display: The extension's popup shows a list of domains and the total time (in minutes) spent on each.
Delete Tracked Data: Users can remove tracking data for specific websites directly from the popup.
Leaderboard: Submit your total tracked time under a username to a local leaderboard.
Leaderboard Management: Clear, export, and import leaderboard data.

Files
background.js: This is the service worker script that runs in the background. It listens for tab changes and updates, calculates time spent on domains, and sends "nudge" messages to active tabs.
content.js: This script is injected into web pages and listens for messages from the background script, specifically for the "nudge" alert.
manifest.json: This file defines the extension's properties, permissions (tabs, storage), background script, content scripts, and popup HTML.
popup.html: The HTML structure for the extension's popup interface, including sections for tracked time and the leaderboard.
popup.js: The JavaScript logic for the popup. It fetches and displays tracked time, handles delete operations, manages leaderboard submissions, and provides import/export functionality.
style.css: Provides basic styling for the body and h1 elements within the popup.
